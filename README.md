# Get Ripped App
I made this app to follow my progress on [Jeff Nippard's UPPER LOWER SIZE AND STRENGTH PROGRAM](https://shop.jeffnippard.com/product/upper-lower-size-and-strength-program-4x/)

The purpose of this app is to:
 - Track the weights I use in each exercise;
 - Keep track where I am on the program;
 - Easy measure my progress since the beggining of the program

What this app won't do: (at least for now)
 - Support other routines besides the one I'm using
 - Support new custom routines
